# Development Log for DMARC Report Analyzer (New Application)

This document serves as a high-level log of development progress for the DMARC Report Analyzer application.

## Logging Convention:

Each day's development activities will be logged in a separate file named `development_log_YYYY-MM-DD.md` within this `docs/` directory.

For example, today's log is located at `development_log_2025-08-03.md`.

This approach ensures a clear, chronological record of changes and decisions.
