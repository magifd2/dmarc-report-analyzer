# Development Log for DMARC Report Analyzer (New Application)

## August 3, 2025 - Initial Backend Setup and DMARC Ingestion

This log details the progress made on the DMARC Report Analyzer application's backend development.

### Key Achievements:

*   **Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Initialized Go module (`dmarc-report-analyzer/backend`).
    *   Established core backend directory structure (`api`, `core`, `db`, `ip_geo`, `auth`, `config`, `util`, `static`).
    *   Added necessary Go dependencies (`go-sqlite3`, `maxminddb-golang`, `publicsuffix`, `gorilla/mux`, `bcrypt`, `golang-jwt/jwt/v5`).

*   **Configuration Management (`backend/src/config`):**
    *   Implemented `config.go` to load application settings (port, database paths, JWT secret) from CLI flags and environment variables.
    *   Ensured `data` and `ip_geo` directories are created and paths are resolved correctly relative to the application root.

*   **Utility Functions (`backend/src/util`):**
    *   Implemented `hash.go` for SHA256 hashing.
    *   Implemented `dns.go` for local DNS PTR lookups.
    *   Implemented `domain.go` for domain name manipulation (reverse domain, apex domain extraction using `publicsuffix`).
    *   Implemented `error.go` for custom application error types.

*   **Database Layer (`backend/src/db`):**
    *   Defined SQLite database schema in `schema.go` including `reports`, `records`, `ip_info`, `ingestion_errors`, `users`, and `settings` tables.
    *   Added `reversed_hostname` and `apex_domain` fields to `ip_info` table for enhanced filtering and aggregation.
    *   Implemented Go structs for database models in `models.go`.
    *   Implemented `repository.go` for common database CRUD operations.
    *   Implemented `user.go` for basic user management (create, get, update password, delete).

*   **IP Geographical Information (`backend/src/ip_geo`):**
    *   Transitioned from MaxMind GeoLite2 to **IPInfo.io free database (.mmdb format)**.
    *   **Removed automatic database download/update functionality** to simplify the architecture.
    *   Implemented `resolver.go` to load and query `.mmdb` files for GeoIP and ASN information.
    *   Implemented `ImportMMDBFile` function to allow **manual import of `.mmdb` files via CLI option (`--import-ip-db`)**.
    *   Successfully configured the application to load the provided `ipinfo_lite.mmdb` file.

*   **DMARC Report Parsing (`backend/src/core/parser`):**
    *   Implemented `types.go` defining Go structs for DMARC XML reports with strict validation logic.
    *   Implemented `parser.go` for robust DMARC report processing:
        *   File type identification using magic numbers and extensions (XML, ZIP, GZ, TGZ).
        *   Extraction of XML content from archives.
        *   XML hashing for duplicate detection.
        *   Strict XML parsing and DMARC schema validation.
        *   Integration with `ip_geo.Resolver` for IP information enrichment.
        *   Saving parsed data to the SQLite database.

*   **Backend Server Core (`backend/src/main.go`):**
    *   Set up the main application entry point.
    *   Integrated configuration, database, IP resolver, and report processor.
    *   Implemented handling for the `--import-ip-db` CLI option.
    *   Set up a basic HTTP router using `gorilla/mux`.

*   **DMARC Report Upload API (`backend/src/api/reports.go`):**
    *   Implemented `POST /api/reports/upload` endpoint to handle multipart file uploads.
    *   Utilizes the `parser.ReportProcessor` to process uploaded DMARC reports.
    *   Returns detailed success/failure information, including ingestion errors.

*   **Server Management Scripts:**
    *   Created `backend/start.sh` and `backend/stop.sh` scripts for reliable background server management (build, start with PID file, stop).

*   **Successful End-to-End Test:**
    *   Successfully uploaded a sample DMARC XML report (`google.com!nlink.jp!1751673600!1751759999.xml`) via `curl` to the running backend server. The report was parsed, IP information resolved, and data saved to the SQLite database without validation errors after resolving XML structure mapping issues.

### Next Steps:

*   Implement remaining backend API endpoints (e.g., for listing reports, fetching report details, user authentication).
*   Develop the frontend application using React (TypeScript) and Tailwind CSS.
*   Implement the packaging of the entire application into a single executable.
